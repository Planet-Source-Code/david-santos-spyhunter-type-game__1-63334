Level Editor for SpyHunter

No LevelEdit = No SpyHunter! :)

Tiles???
========
Problem:  

How can we create a scrolling playing field? Create one whole level as a bitmap and scroll
it across the screen?  That would be too big.

Solution:

Nintendo created this solution long ago with Mario Brothers, and all Nintendo games.  Store fixed bitmaps of parts of the level that are repeated.  Like only one block for a road, another for a wall, etc.

Then make a nifty little level editor that references the blocks (or tiles) as numbers, so that nothing = 0, ladder = 1, brick = 2 etc.  The level editor works visually, but stores the position of
the tile in an array. for example:

   0000000000
   2222122222
   0000100000   Each number corresponds to one tile.
   2222100000   The level editor simply changes the 
   0000100000   tile number at the location.
   0000100000
   0000100222
   0000100000
   2222222222

Okay, but how do we know if the tile will support mario, or if he will fall through?
We can relate that information to the tile number, or ee can create another array of 
tile-effect data for each tile:

  tile 0 = 0
  tile 1 = 0    0 means mario will fall through
  tile 2 = 1    1 means mario will not fall through


So, how about obstacles? Same thing as the first layer of tiles.  This new layer will be
superimposed over the previous layer.

   1 = koopa troopa

   0000000000
   0000000000
   0001000000   
   0000000000   A koopa troopa will appear over
   0000000000   the left ledge of two's in the first layer
   0000000000
   0000000000
   0000000000
   0000000000


Draw the first layer, then draw the obtacle layer.



Using LevelEdit
===============
Creating a level

1. Creating the Road Layer
--------------------------

Under Drawing Tools Select Road in the combobox.  You can drag-select to highlight more than 
one tiles to draw on the map at the same time.

Click on the Draw Button under the combobox. This will set your Pen mode to draw.

Click in the map area to place you selected tile. TO change the current tile, click on another 
tile in the Tile area.

Make a road using the dustroad, cement road, and bridges.  Make road bends with the diamond 
figures.  All you have to do is make it look neat and straight.

Grass is set to slow the player down.  Water in unpassable, as are bridges, tree stumps,
etc.  Unpassable means that the player will crash into it if he is not in a jump.

The Ramp (double arrows) is set to cause a jump when the user passes over. use before
a water trap, etc.

use the scroll bar to move up/down the entire level.

2.  Create the object layer.
----------------------------

Under Drawing Tools select Objects.

First off, the red car must appear in the first row of the level.  put it over the road you made.  
Put blue and black cars as you will.  Fuel objects refill the car.


3.  Deleting Road/Objects
-------------------------

If you make a mistake, Click on the Select button underneath the combobox.
select a tile or tiles in the map area, and press the delete key to remove the
selected road/objects from the map.


Passable, Slows DOwn, Causes Jump
=================================
These options are store in RoadInfo.Dat and determines how each road tile will affect the player.
The Roadinfo has already been set so I wouldn't recommend fiddling with the check boxes since 
they are automatically saved whenever you exit the program.


EXIT
====

You may see a tile labeled EXIT under Objects. This is a special tile that causes the program to drive 
your car off the screen and move to the next level. Please remember to add a row of EXIT tiles before you
reach the end of your map.
