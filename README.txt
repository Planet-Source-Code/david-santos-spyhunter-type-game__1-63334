SpyHunter 1/3
-------------

Known Bugs
- Firing at an enemy might cause you to die if you are right behind him.
  I don't know what this really is, but I think its because when the enemy dies,
  he leaves an mark behind that is still read as if a car is still there

- Oil slick, warning devices, and potholes don't do anything yet.

Files
=====

These BMPS are carefully aligned to 32 x 32 pixels. Modifying carelessly
will cause graphics disruption in the game/level editor.

OBJECTDAT.BMP - the visible objects that are displayed in SpyHunter 1/3,
       arranged in 32 x 32 tiles

OBJECTS MASK.BMP - the mask for the objects to be displayed in LevelEdit.
       This mask allows us to display one object over another, like a GIF,
       with the transparent areas showing through. In this case, anything 
       WHITE will be transparent.

OBJECTS.BMP - the objects to be displayed in LevelEdit. used in conjuntion
       with the mask.

OTHER.BMP - extra tiles used in SpyHunter 1/3.  Explosion, Gas meter, numers. 

ROAD.BMP - the road graphics used in both LevelEdit and SpyHunter 1/3

TITLE.BMP - Gran Turismo 3, anyone?

*.MAP - MAP Files generated by LevelEdit.  Contains data for the levels. 
       MUST start at 1.  There is no provision for a final level, sorry.

       If you want, add to Sub newLevel after "level = level + 1" some code that
       will detect if level goes past some value, like "if level > 9 then level = 1"
       so that the game will loop after level 9

ROADINFO.DAT - 55 bytes of information specifying what will happen when the car passes
       over a certain road type.  These can be set by checking appropriate items
       under Drawing Tools in LevelEdit after clicking on a roadtype.
       See LevelEdit Docs
